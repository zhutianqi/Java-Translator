All parts of this assignment should be in working order.

program ::= block
block ::= declaration_list statement_list
declaration_list ::= {declaration}
statement_list ::= {statement}

declaration ::= ’@’ id { ’,’ id }

statement ::= assignment | print | do | if
print ::= ’!’ expr
assignment ::= ref_id ’=’ expr
ref_id ::= [ ’ ̃’ [ number ] ] id
do ::= ’<’ guarded_command ’>’
if ::= ’[’ guarded_command { ’|’ guarded_command } [ ’%’ block ] ’]’
for ::= '$' '<' expr ':' assignment ':' block '>'
guarded_command ::= expr ’:’ block

expr ::= term { addop term }
term ::= factor { multop factor }
factor ::= ’(’ expr ’)’ | ref_id | number
addop ::= ’+’ | ’-’
multop ::= ’*’ | ’/’

I chose this particular form because it keeps with the spirit of the E language. It has a very simple syntax, like the other control statements in this language. It echoes the do statement, albeit with extra parameters. Like the rest of the language, a negative expression is true, and a positive one is false. All in all, I chose this form because it is concise, simple, and keeps with the spirit of the E language.
